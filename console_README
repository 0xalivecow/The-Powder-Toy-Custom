### CONSOLE ###
the console in this version is a python console and will execute any command you enter.
the api for interacting with the powder toy is contained in the tpt module and is already imported at startup.
currently implemented api functions:
    tpt.create(x,y,type)         create a particle of type <type> at <x>,<y>
    tpt.reset_velocity()         resets all velocity
    tpt.reset_pressure()         resets all pressure
    tpt.reset_sparks()           resets all sparks
    tpt.set_life(type,life)      sets the life of all particles with type <type>
                                 to <life>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_type(type1,type2)    sets the type of all particles with type <type1>
                                 to <type2>(set <type1> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_temp(type,temp)      sets the temp of all particles with type <type>
                                 to <temp>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_tmp(type,tmp)        sets the tmp of all particles with type <type> 
                                 to <tmp>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_x(type,x)            sets the x of all particles with type <type>
                                 to <x>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_y(type,y)            sets the y of all particles with type <type>
                                 to <y>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_vx(type,vx)          sets the vx of all particles with type <type>
                                 to <vx>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_vy(type,vy)          sets the vy of all particles with type <type>
                                 to <vy>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.set_ctype(type,ctype)    sets the ctype of all particles with type
                                 <type> to <ctype>(set <type> to -1 for all)
    tpt.pause()                  pause the game(note that closing the console
                                 pauses the game)
    tpt.unpause()                unpause the game(note that closing the console
                                 pauses the game)
    tpt.toggle_pause()           toggle pause(note that closing the console
                                 pauses the game)
    tpt.close_console()          closes the console and pauses the game
    tpt.open_console()           opens the console
    tpt.toggle_console()         toggles the console

NOTE: these functions don't do bounds checking, which means that they CAN AND
      WILL CRASH the powder toy. be carefull.

### TIPS&TRICKS ###
all functions that need a particle type expect a number. but instead of doing
tpt.set_life(32,life) you can do tpt.set_life(element['uran'],life)

### COMPILING ###
before you compile you should have python 2.x installed.
you must run the "getheader.py" script to get the correct linking options, add
these options to the makefile
